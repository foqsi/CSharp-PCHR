# C# Final Project
This was my final project for a C# course at OCCC.
A database was provided for the project. 
I used migration builder to add columns to tables, and also to create a one-to-many relationship. I've included some images of the UI.

Note:
Not all of the files were uploaded, and I didn't include the DB to help prevent other students from using my code.
